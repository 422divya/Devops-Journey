1- What is Git and Github
2- Different Version control system - Centralized VCS and Distributed VCS
3- Git commands:

1- git init: To initialze the directory. It will create .git directory. It creates empty git repository.
When we save file in git that is being saved in .git folder

2- git status: Provides repository status

3- git add filename : to add file in staging area which will be tracked by git 

4- git commit -m "message" : Commit the tracked files in git repository.

5- git log: provide details of file like Author, Hasdhid, Date

6- git restore file_name: To bring back or rever the changes. If file is delete from local system but it is present in git repository that can be restored by this command.

7- git clone git_repo_from_github: To clone repository from github. Clones the already created repository

8- git remote -v: Remote connection of repository from local to remote. It shows if local repository is linked to any remote github repository.

9- git remote add origin github_repo_url: origin is varaiable which has remote url(github url)

10- git remote set-url origin https://token@github_repo.rpeo : To change origin value. We are setting here origin with access token so while pushing to github git will not ask for credentials.

11- git push origin master: To push the files/dir to the remote diretory i.e on github repository.

12- git checkout -b branch_name : -b Create branch from master/main. Also it will switch to new created branch.

13- git checkout master: To swich to master branch.

14- git status: It will also give on which branch you are in now currently.

15- git push origin new_branch: It will create new branch ib github and push the chnages in it.

16- git merge new_branch: It merges changes to main branch. Before this swtich to main branch git checkout master and then run merge command.


*** fork: It will copy repository to our github. .git repositor from where we fork the git repository and .git repository in our system will be different, it will not be linked.

*** sync fork: It will sync the changes from the main repository to the fork repository.


*** Pull request: It is used in remote to merge the branches. In background it runs git merge command.


*** clone: When we clone any repository .git directory is linked. 
So if we make any changes on local from our end and push, it will directly push to the original repository from where we have cloned it.
Also whatever changed are being made in main repository will not be reflected in cloned one.




*** Git stages: ***
1- Working Directory- Files/directories in local system. Untracted files
2- Staging area - When we bring files in staging area those becomes Tracked files/directories. Git is trcaking files now. Using git add to bring file from working to staging area.
3- Git repository- Files saved in git repository from staging area. Using git commit
